            <font size="3"><b>Codestars by Rob Percival</b></font><br><br>
			Rob Percival wants to revolutionize the way people learn to code by making it simple, logical, fun and, above all, accessible. But as just one man, Rob couldn't create all the courses his students, more than half a million of them, wanted. That's why Rob created Codestars. Together, the instructors that make up the Codestars team create courses on all the topics that students want to learn in the way that students want to learn them: courses that are well-structured, super interactive, and easy to understand. Codestars wants to make it as easy as possible for learners of all ages and levels to build functional websites and apps.<br><br>
			<font size="3"><b>Jose Salvatierra</b></font> - Founder of School of Code and Computer Science instructor<br><br>
			He's been teaching computer science and playing and teaching music (grades 1 to 8) for over four years, to students of all ages and all skill levels. He started programming at the age of 10. Ever since he started learning to the program he knew he wanted to study Computer Science. Half a decade ago, he ended up at the University of Dundee, studying Applied Computing. He has worked for "Eseye", an M2M company, as an intern doing mainly backend developing, writing PHP scripts and programming Zenoss ZenPacks, and currently work for Skyscanner, one of Scotland's largest technology companies, programming mainly in Python and web languages. At the moment, he enjoys programming in Python, Java and C, playing and recording music, usually as an accompanying pianist for singers, and sports and bodybuilding. He ensures that his courses are interesting to you, enjoyable and that you learn from them!
